## Pull request template

- You are required to create a pull request according to these steps:
    - Use the `pull_request_template.md` file when writing the description section in the pull request
    - The `title` of the pull request should follow the format below:
        - `Feature/Topic/Hotfix/Fix: Task Name`. Example: `Feature: Build View Controller`
        - Explain:
            - `Feature`: When the branch has the task of changing the main code of the project
            - `Topic`: When the branch only has the task of research, without directly changing the main code of the project
            - `Hotfix`: When you discover code on the production environment
            - `Fix`: When you discover a bug in a branch that has not been merged into the production environment
    - After creating the pull request, decide who will merge the code within your team.
    - You don't need to follow the Wxx format as I mentioned before
    - Each person will have multiple pull requests
    - Whoever makes the pull request, attach that pull request to the report you attached above. Section `pull request(s)`
